## Background

This repository contains individual directories for the [weekly challenges][alteryx_weekly_challenges] posted in the [Alteryx Community][alteryx_community].

Alteryx is the leader in self-service data analytics and it provides analysts the unique ability to easily clean, prep, blend and analyze all of their data using a repeatable workflow and finally, deploy and share the analytics at scale for deeper insights in hours, not weeks.

Based on the type of challenge; each directory might contain these sub-directories:

Alteryx-Weekly-Challenges<br>
├─ DATA<br>
├─ WORKFLOW<br>
├─ MACRO<br>
├─ APP<br>
├─ REPORT<br>

The type of content present in the directories is as follows:

**DATA**

This directory contains the dataset(s) required for the challenge

**WORKFLOW**

This directory contains the solution Alteryx workflow(s).

> This could be an optional directory in few challenges

**MACRO**

This directory contains any custom macro that is being used by the Alteryx workflow.

> This is an optional directory and might not present in each challenge.

**APP**

This directory contains the Analytical App that we have to create for solving the given challenge.

> This is an optional directory and might not present in each challenge.

**Report**

This directory contains the visually appealing analytics report that we might need to create as a part of the problem.

> This is an optional directory and might not present in each challenge.

## Prerequisites

The toughness level of weekly challenge could vary from basic to advance and in order to follow along; a full installation of Alteryx Designer software is required.

Having a basic to intermediate level of understanding in Alteryx would definitely help in understanding of solution workflows.

## Contents

I am a big Alteryx fan and love to solve weekly challenges and I'd definitely encourage you to participate in the Alteryx weekly challenges as well,

Solving Alteryx weekly challenges is a great way to boost your ETL understanding & it also makes you familiar with tools and techniques used in Alteryx to solve complex problems quickly.

You can follow my work at Alteryx Community here: [Alteryx Community | @quantumudit][alteryx_community_profile]

By using the below table you can easily navigate to any Alteryx challenge directory that I have in the repository:
